Commute Buddy — Project Overview

1.  Project Summary
    York University is known as a commuter school, with thousands of students traveling from various parts of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) every day. Many students take the same buses, subways, or trains but are unaware of peers on the same route. Commute Buddy is a web application designed exclusively for York University students to make commuting more social, safe, and efficient by connecting users traveling on similar routes at similar times.

    The system will allow users to share their planned or active commute, match with others using the same route, and receive real-time notifications when another student is taking the same bus or train.

2.  Project Objectives

    **Enhance Student Connectivity:** Help students find commuting peers to make daily travel less isolating.

    **Improve Safety and Comfort:** Encourage students to travel together, especially during late hours or long routes.

    **Optimize Commute Planning:** Allow users to view route overlaps and match with others heading to York at similar times.

    **Build a York-exclusive Community:** Restrict access to verified York University email accounts for security and authenticity.

3.  Key Users

    **Primary Users:** York University students who commute to campus using public transportation.

    **Secondary Users:** York University staff or teaching assistants who also commute.

    **Administrators:** University-approved moderators ensuring student verification, route integrity, and data privacy.

4.  Key Use Cases

    ## User Registration & Verification

        - A student signs up using their official York University email.

        - Email verification confirms their status as a York student.

    ## Route Setup

        - The user enters their common route (e.g., Finch Station → York University).

        - Optionally saves multiple routes for different days or schedules.

    ## Commute Detection & Matching

        - The system detects when a user starts their commute (via manual check-in or GPS).

        - Matches are found based on overlapping routes and estimated departure times.

        - The user receives a notification: “Another York student, Sarah L., is also on the 60 Steeles West heading to York right now.”

    ## Real-Time Notifications

        - Users receive updates about nearby commuters in real time.

        - Privacy controls ensure only verified York students can see limited commute details.

    ## Community and Feedback Features (Optional Stretch Goal)

        - Users can give route safety feedback or report issues.

        - Add friend or “favorite route partner” functionality for regular commuters.

5.  Key Usage Scenarios

    ## Scenario 1: Morning Commute Connection

        Alex, a first-year York student, checks into Commute Buddy before leaving for the 7:30 AM bus. The app notifies him that another student, Priya, is also on the same route. They decide to meet at the stop and commute together.

    ## Scenario 2: Late Evening Safety

        After an evening lab, Sarah opens the app and sees that two other York students are heading to Finch Station via the 196 Express. Feeling safer, she joins them.

    ## Scenario 3: Route Planning for New Students

        A new student, Daniel, uses the app to explore common routes from his area. He finds the most popular ones used by others and adjusts his schedule accordingly.

6.  Conclusion
    Commute Buddy aims to make commuting to York University a more connected, safe, and community-driven experience. By leveraging route matching and real-time notifications, it turns solitary travel into an opportunity for engagement and shared safety. The project integrates social networking principles with practical utility—built by York commuters, for York commuters.
