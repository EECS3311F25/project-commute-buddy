# Process Documentation

## 🧭 Introduction

In any group project, the foundation of success lies in how well the team is **organized and coordinated**. A team without proper structure is bound to face challenges and inefficiencies.

To avoid this, we focused on forming a team with **shared goals** and **clear expectations** from the very beginning. Before finalizing members, we discussed our commitment levels and ensured that everyone was equally motivated to achieve the highest possible results, to not just _pass the course_. This early alignment played a key role in our smooth collaboration throughout the project.

## 👥 Team Organization

During **Sprint 0**, our primary mode of communication was **WhatsApp**, which allowed for quick and informal discussions. As the project progressed, we incorporated:

- **Trello** → for task management and tracking progress
- **Discord** → for structured communication and voice meetings
- **WhatsApp** → continued as our main channel for quick updates and reminders

Since most of us live on or near campus, we frequently met **after class** to discuss progress and address problems. Even if a member was unable to attend a class, they often joined our meetups briefly — either in person or online — ensuring consistent participation.

## 🧩 Decision Making

Decision-making within our team was **smooth and collaborative**. Many of us had previously worked together in other courses, which fostered trust and mutual respect. Everyone was encouraged to express their opinions openly and to back them up with logical reasoning.

When disagreements occurred:

- We discussed the issue thoroughly
- Conducted a quick vote
- Reached consensus immediately in most cases

On the rare occasion of a **split vote**, we revisited the topic after additional discussion and re-voted to ensure fairness and clarity.

## 🧮 Priority Points – User Stories

Assigning **story points** was initially challenging. While our decision-making process was effective, estimating user stories required a different perspective.

Initially, we based our estimates on **implementation difficulty** rather than **time required**. However, since each member’s skill set varies, what seemed easy for one person might be harder for another.

To address this:

- We discussed each story in detail
- Re-evaluated several stories after feedback
- Averaged **two rounds of voting per user story** before reaching a final consensus

This process helped us better align on effort estimation and set realistic sprint goals.

---

## 📅 Frequency of Meetings

As per our **team contract**, we met **at least once per week**. Although, in practice, we usually met **twice weekly** — typically after our two scheduled classes.

Regular meetings allowed us to:

- Maintain progress and accountability
- Address blockers quickly
- Ensure everyone was aligned on current sprint goals

For members unable to attend physically, **online participation** kept them up to date. Our proximity to campus made this regular schedule easy to maintain.

## 💡 Lessons for the Next Phase

We learned several key lessons that will guide us moving forward:

1. **Time Management:**  
   Collaborative projects require dedicated hours beyond class time. Setting aside focused time for team work and planning is essential to meet deadlines efficiently.

2. **Continuous Collaboration:**  
   Unlike individual assignments, this project depends on ongoing communication and shared progress tracking.

3. **Conflict Resolution & Awareness:**  
   As deadlines approached, tensions sometimes rose. We learned the importance of **situational awareness**, **empathy**, and maintaining a **positive, calm environment** even under stress.

These lessons will help us operate even more effectively in the next phases of development.
